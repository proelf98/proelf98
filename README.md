## 🌱 About me
Originally I have technically background in electric engineering ⚡, but fell in love with programming 😍.
I've a Bachelor degree in Electric Engineering 🎓  and currently working on my master degree in Visual Computing and Games Technologies at the H-BRS in Germany 🇩🇪.
During my masters degree I worked partime as a research assistant and worked on a project for Software visualization.

My greatest power is that I have broad skillset, that originates from having not a classic computer scientist career and the need of quickly adapting to new tasks.
